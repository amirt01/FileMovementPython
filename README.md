# FileMovementPython
Exploring more python this time I am looking at moving files between folders.

This script will initialize your downloads folder with a system of folders for the major generalized types. It will transfer your files into those folders at startup, as well as whenever a new file is added to your downloads folder.

Make sure to install watchdog using pip install watchdog

Add the filemovement.py file to C:\Users\user-name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup for the script to run at startup.
